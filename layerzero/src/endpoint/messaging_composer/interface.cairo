/// # `IMessagingComposer` Interface
///
/// The `IMessagingComposer` manages compose payloads that are sent after a LayerZero message has
/// been delivered.
///
/// ## Key features
/// - Queueing of compose payloads by the originating OApp
/// - Verified delivery of compose payloads to a target contract
/// - Optional value transfer (ERC20) to the target prior to callback
/// - Alerting hooks for off-chain/executor reporting
/// - Introspection of the compose queue state
#[starknet::interface]

    /// Records the keccak hash of `message` keyed by (sender, `to`, `guid`, `index`).
    /// A corresponding delivery will be executed via `lz_compose` by an executor.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `to` - Target contract that will receive the compose callback
    /// * `guid` - Unique identifier of the original LayerZero message
    /// * `index` - Compose index associated with the original message
    /// * `message` - Opaque compose payload
    ///
    /// # Emits
    /// * ComposeSent
    ///

    /// * If a compose payload is already queued for the given (sender, `to`, `guid`, `index`)
