/// # `IEndpointV2` Interface
///
/// The `IEndpointV2` interface is the central component of the LayerZero protocol, designed to
/// facilitate seamless, secure, and efficient cross-chain messaging. As the primary entry point for
/// all LayerZero messages, the EndpointV2 contract manages the entire lifecycle of a message, from
/// sending to receiving, while ensuring reliable delivery and robust security. It provides a
/// comprehensive set of functionalities that enable developers to build sophisticated omnichain
/// applications (OApps) with ease.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - **Message Sending and Receiving**: Core functions for sending and receiving messages across
/// different blockchains,
///   abstracting away the complexities of cross-chain communication.
/// - **Configurable Security**: OApps can define their own security requirements by specifying a
/// set of Data Verification
///   Networks (DVNs) and a threshold of required verifications, ensuring that each message meets
///   the application's security standards.
/// - **Fee Quotation**: Provides a mechanism to quote the cost of sending a message, allowing
/// applications to estimate
///   and manage transaction fees transparently.
/// - **Message Verification and Execution**: Verifies the authenticity of incoming messages through
/// the configured DVNs
///   and ensures that only valid messages are executed.
/// - **Commit-Store-Execute Pattern**: Implements a secure message handling pattern where message
/// commitments are stored
///   on-chain and executed only after successful verification, preventing race conditions and other
///   security vulnerabilities.
/// - **Alerts and Error Handling**: Includes a system for receiving alerts about failed messages,
/// enabling robust error
///   handling and recovery mechanisms.
/// - **Delegate and Token Management**: Supports delegation of OApp configuration management and
/// allows for the use of
///   a specific token for paying LayerZero fees.
