/// # Executor Fee Library Interface
///
/// This interface defines the standard functions for a LayerZero Executor Fee Library.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities
/// 1.  **Fee Calculation:** Calculating the cost of message execution on a destination chain.
///     The fee is determined by factors such as the destination endpoint ID (EID), the size of the
///     message payload, and the gas price on the destination chain, which is obtained from a price
///     feed.
/// 2.  **Versioning:** Exposing its version number to allow for upgrades and compatibility checks.
///
/// The fee calculation can be performed in two ways:
/// - `get_fee`: A view function that returns the fee without any state changes. This is useful for
/// quoting.
/// - `get_fee_on_send`: An external function that calculates the fee and may perform state changes,
///   for example, to record fee-related data.
