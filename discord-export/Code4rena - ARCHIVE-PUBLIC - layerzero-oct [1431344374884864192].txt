🔎 **Got audit-related questions? Here's your roadmap** 

Find the information you need efficiently:

Step 1: **Review project documentation** in the audit repo. [Join the audit](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-10-layerzero-starknet-endpoint) for access.
Step 2: Use 🤖 Docs Wolf, C4's documentation bot assistant. Open a private thread, tag `@Docs Wolf`, and ask your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.

Please note: 
- Docs Wolf will be available within 24-48 hours of launch. We'll post a note once it's live.
- The LayerZero team is **not available** for questions, so the Q&A option has been disabled for this competition.

Good hunting!
